Developed by Arnaud Avondet, Joey Wildman, Yuma Matsuoka, and Kent Shibata for Tartanhacks 2021. Hayane ("Early to Bed" in Japanese) is a companionship website that allows users to set a status in their "dorm" of either studying, sleeping, or vibing. Students can join and leave the dorm on their own. Students get to see their fellow friends' statuses and build a sense of community no matter where they are. The app also encourages healthy sleeping habits by showing when students are "sleeping" as a form of peer motivation.
